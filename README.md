# 📜 About the Project
- Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing is a machine learning project aimed at forecasting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit after a bank's telemarketing campaign.
- By leveraging client data, campaign details, and previous interactions, the project uses ML algorithms to enhance marketing strategies.

## 🚀 Project Title:
Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing

## 📂 Project Type:
Machine Learning Project (MLP) - T32024

## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is related to direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The campaigns were conducted through phone calls, sometimes requiring multiple contacts to determine if the client would subscribe to a term deposit.

## 📄 Files Included:
- 📋 train.csv - The training dataset
- 📋 test.csv - The test dataset
- 📋 sample_submission.csv - A sample submission file in the required format

## 🔑 Input Variables (Features):
1. last contact date - Date of last client contact

2. age - Client's age (numeric)

3. job - Type of job (categorical)

4. marital - Marital status (categorical: "married", "divorced", "single")

5. education - Level of education (categorical: "unknown", "secondary", "primary", "tertiary")

6. default - Credit in default? (binary: "yes", "no")

7. balance - Average yearly balance (numeric)

8. housing - Has housing loan? (binary: "yes", "no")

9. loan - Has personal loan? (binary: "yes", "no")

10. contact - Contact communication type (categorical: "unknown", "telephone", "cellular")

11. duration - Duration of last contact (numeric, in seconds)

12. campaign - Number of contacts during this campaign (numeric)

13. pdays - Days passed since last client contact (numeric, -1 if not previously contacted)

14. previous - Number of contacts before this campaign (numeric)

15. poutcome - Outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown", "other", "failure", "success")

## 🎯 Target Variable:
- target - Has the client subscribed to a term deposit? (binary: "yes", "no")

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution.

- Preprocess and clean the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.

- Train various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a successful campaign.

- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

- Generate predictions for the test dataset and submit them in the required format.

## 🚀 Approach
1. **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

- Visualize the distribution of features.

- Identify correlations and key features impacting the target variable.

2. **🛠️ Data Preprocessing**:

- Handle missing values.

- Encode categorical variables.

- Scale numeric features if necessary.

3. **🏋️‍♂️ Model Training**:

- Experiment with models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

- Use cross-validation for better model generalization.

4. **📋 Evaluation**:

- Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to assess model performance.

5. **🔮 Submission**:

- Generate predictions and prepare submission in the required format.
